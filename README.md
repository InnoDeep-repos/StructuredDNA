# StructuredDNA
StructuredDNA is a novel sparse architecture framework inspired by biological systems (DNA hierarchies) and physical chemistry (binding forces, energy minimization). It replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided layer based on semantic energy minimization
